# Conversation TTS — Multi-Engine Voice Generator

Convert a JSON conversation script into a natural-sounding MP3 with distinct voices for each speaker. Supports four TTS engines — swap between them with a single line in your `.env`.

## Project Structure

```
project/
├── conversation_tts.py   # Main script
├── .env                  # Your credentials (never commit this)
├── .env.example          # Template — copy to .env
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── README.md
│
├── input/                # ← Place your JSON conversation files here
│   └── conversation.json
│
├── output/               # ← Generated MP3s are saved here (auto-created)
│   └── conversation.mp3
│
└── temp/                 # ← Per-run temp folders live here (auto-created & deleted)
    └── tts_run_XXXX/     #   exists only during synthesis, wiped when done
```

The `input/` and `output/` folders are created automatically next to the script if they don't exist. Any temporary files created during synthesis are placed in a system temp directory and **deleted automatically** when the run completes (or fails).

## Installation

### 1. Install Python dependencies

```bash
# Core (always required)
pip install requests pydub python-dotenv

# Amazon Polly only
pip install boto3

# gTTS only
pip install gtts
```

Or install everything at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install ffmpeg (required by pydub for MP3 handling)

| OS | Command |
|---|---|
| macOS | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| Ubuntu / Debian | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` |
| Windows | Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH |

### 3. Configure your `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your credentials (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).

### 4. Add your conversation JSON

```bash
cp conversation.json input/my_conversation.json
# edit as needed
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run with default engine (elevenlabs)
python conversation_tts.py --input conversation.json
# reads:  input/conversation.json
# writes: output/conversation.mp3

# Custom output filename
python conversation_tts.py --input conversation.json --output heart_attack.mp3
# writes: output/heart_attack.mp3

# Switch engine via CLI flag (overrides .env)
python conversation_tts.py --input conversation.json --engine gtts

# List available JSON files in input/
python conversation_tts.py --list-inputs

# List available voices for the active engine
python conversation_tts.py --list-voices
```

---

## Configuration

### `.env` file

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values for the engine(s) you want to use.

```env
# ── Pick one engine ────────────────────────────────────────────
TTS_ENGINE=elevenlabs
#TTS_ENGINE=openai_tts
#TTS_ENGINE=amazon_polly
#TTS_ENGINE=gtts

# ── ElevenLabs ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID=eleven_multilingual_v2

# ── OpenAI TTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_TTS_MODEL=tts-1

# ── Amazon Polly ───────────────────────────────────────────────
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
POLLY_ENGINE=neural

# ── gTTS (no key needed) ───────────────────────────────────────
GTTS_SLOW=false
```

**Priority:** CLI `--engine` flag → `TTS_ENGINE` in `.env` → defaults to `elevenlabs`.

> ⚠️ Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` — never commit API keys.

## Conversation JSON Format

Place JSON files in the `input/` folder. The file has three sections:

```json
{
  "voices": { ... },
  "voice_settings": { ... },
  "conversation": [ ... ]
}
```

### `voices`

Define a voice per speaker for each engine. The script automatically picks the right section based on `TTS_ENGINE`.

```json
"voices": {
  "elevenlabs"  : { "doctor": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM", "patient": "pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB" },
  "openai_tts"  : { "doctor": "nova",    "patient": "onyx"    },
  "amazon_polly": { "doctor": "Joanna",  "patient": "Matthew" },
  "gtts"        : { "doctor": "en",      "patient": "en-uk"   }
}
```

### `voice_settings` *(optional, ElevenLabs only)*

Fine-tune the expressiveness of each speaker independently.

```json
"voice_settings": {
  "doctor":  { "stability": 0.55, "similarity_boost": 0.75, "style": 0.25 },
  "patient": { "stability": 0.40, "similarity_boost": 0.80, "style": 0.50 }
}
```

| Parameter | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `stability` | 0 – 1 | Higher = more consistent, less expressive |
| `similarity_boost` | 0 – 1 | Higher = closer to the original voice |
| `style` | 0 – 1 | Higher = more expressive / emotional |
| `use_speaker_boost` | bool | Enhances voice clarity |

### `conversation`

An ordered list of `{ "speaker", "text" }` objects. Speaker names must match keys in `voices`.

```json
"conversation": [
  { "speaker": "doctor",  "text": "How are you feeling today?" },
  { "speaker": "patient", "text": "Not great, I have chest pain." }
]
```

## Temp File Cleanup

All intermediate audio files are written into `temp/tts_run_XXXX/` — a sub-folder created at the start of each run and deleted at the end via Python's `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`.

**How it works under the hood:**

Every engine receives a `tmp_dir: Path` argument. Instead of passing raw bytes to pydub via `BytesIO` (which caused pydub to create its own uncontrolled temp files), the script uses a `_bytes_to_segment()` helper that:

1. Writes the API response bytes to a real file inside `tmp_dir` using `tempfile.mkstemp(dir=tmp_dir)`
2. Passes that file path directly to `AudioSegment.from_file()`
3. Leaves the file in `tmp_dir` to be cleaned up automatically

This means pydub never needs to create temp files of its own — every intermediate file is accounted for inside `temp/tts_run_XXXX/`, and the entire folder is wiped when the run finishes.

**To verify cleanup during development**, pause the script after synthesis:

```python
# In conversation_tts.py, after generate_conversation():
input("Paused — inspect temp/ now, then press Enter to continue and delete")
```

You will see `temp/tts_run_XXXX/` populated with one `.mp3` file per spoken line. Press Enter and the folder disappears.

## Extending with a New Engine

1. Create a class inheriting from `TTSEngine`
2. Implement `synthesize()` and `list_voices()`
3. Add a branch in `build_engine()`
4. Add the engine's voice mapping to your JSON

```python
class MyCustomEngine(TTSEngine):
    name = "my_engine"

    def synthesize(self, text, voice, speaker, voice_settings, tmp_dir):
        # Always write to tmp_dir — auto-deleted when the run completes
        tmp_file = tmp_dir / "chunk.wav"
        # ... call your API, save to tmp_file ...
        return AudioSegment.from_file(tmp_file, format="wav")

    def list_voices(self):
        print("my voice list")
```
